# Guess the Number Game (Fermi, Pico, Bagel)
# Description
This is an interactive Python game based on the "Fermi, Pico, Bagel" logic puzzle. The program generates a random 3-digit number (with unique digits), and your goal is to guess the number. You will receive feedback based on your guess:

Fermi: Correct digit in the correct position.
Pico: Correct digit but in the wrong position.
Bagel: No correct digits.
You have 6 attempts to guess the secret number correctly.

# How It Works
The program generates a random 3-digit number with unique digits (e.g., 345, 728, etc.).
You enter your guess, which is also a 3-digit number.
The game provides feedback after each guess:
Fermi: The digit is correct and in the correct position.
Pico: The digit is correct but in the wrong position.
Bagel: No digits are correct.
The game continues until you either guess the correct number or run out of attempts.

# Requirements
  Python 3.6 or higher.
# How to Run
Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
Open the guess_the_number.py file in any Python editor or IDE.
Run the program using Python 3:
  python guess_the_number.py
Follow the prompts and enjoy the game!
# Contributing
Feel free to contribute if you have suggestions for improvements or would like to enhance the game. Some ideas for improvements:

Add a timer for each round to increase the challenge.
Include different difficulty levels (e.g., 4-digit numbers, more attempts).
Improve the UI with a graphical interface.
